<h3>
    
Do note that status flags are sent by the SERVER. Thus, many custom servers
may only send essential flags such as on fire or sneaking. However, more niche flags
are expected to be sent by the vanilla bedrock server.

The other status flags do not apply to players and are thus omitted from the documentation (for now)
